This project modifies the behavior of villager spawn replacement, allowing both vanilla Villagers and pixelmon quest givers to exist in the same world.

Any village that is generated will spawn with villagers, but any Nitwit will automatically convert to a quest giver.

Similarly, any normal villager can be converted using a new item, the Pink Slip, immediately removing them from their position.
