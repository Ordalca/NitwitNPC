This project modifies the behavior of villager spawn replacement, allowing both minecraft Villagers and Pixelmon quest givers to exist in the same world.

Any village that is generated will spawn with villagers, but any Nitwit will automatically convert to a quest giver. Similarly, any jobless villager can be converted to a quest giver by giving them a piece of mail.
 
Healers, shopkeepers, trainers, and tutors that spawn as part of the village's structures all remain in their roles rather than becoming villagers.
